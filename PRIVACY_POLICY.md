# Meetily Privacy Policy

*Last updated: [Current Date]*

## Our Privacy-First Commitment

Meetily is built on the principle that your meeting data should remain private and under your control. This privacy policy explains how we handle data in our open-source meeting assistant.

## Data Processing Philosophy

### Local-First Processing
- **Meeting transcription**: Processed entirely on your device using local Whisper models
- **Audio recordings**: Never transmitted to external servers
- **Meeting content**: Remains on your infrastructure
- **AI summaries**: Generated locally or through your chosen LLM provider

### Your Data Ownership
- You own all meeting data, transcripts, and recordings
- Data is stored locally on your device
- No vendor lock-in - export your data anytime
- Complete control over data retention and deletion

## Usage Analytics

### What We Collect
Usage analytics is optional and off by default. When you choose to enable it, Meetily collects minimal, anonymized usage data:

**Application Usage:**
- Feature usage patterns (which tools you use most)
- Session duration and frequency
- Performance metrics (transcription success rates, error frequencies)
- UI interaction patterns (button clicks, navigation flows)

**Technical Metrics:**
- Application version and platform information
- Error logs and crash reports (anonymized)
- Performance benchmarks (processing times, resource usage)

### What We DON'T Collect
We never collect:
- ❌ Meeting content, transcripts, or recordings
- ❌ Personal information or identifiable data
- ❌ File names, meeting titles, or metadata
- ❌ Audio data or voice patterns
- ❌ Participant names or contact information
- ❌ LLM conversations or AI-generated content

### Why We Collect This Data
When enabled, analytics helps us with:
- **Product Quality**: Identifying and fixing bugs that impact user experience
- **Performance Optimization**: Understanding resource usage and system bottlenecks
- **Security**: Detecting potential security issues and vulnerabilities
- **Feature Development**: Making data-driven decisions about new features
- **Open Source Sustainability**: Ensuring the project meets user needs effectively

### Analytics Implementation
- **Provider**: None (100% Offline Build).
- **Telemetry**: PostHog and remote telemetry libraries have been completely removed.
- **Network Traffic**: Zero analytics or usage data leaves your machine.

## Third-Party Services

### LLM Providers (Optional)
If you choose to use external LLM providers:
- **Anthropic Claude**: Subject to Anthropic's privacy policy
- **Groq**: Subject to Groq's privacy policy
- **Local Ollama**: Processed entirely on your device with no external transmission

### Analytics Service
- **Status**: Disabled and purged from binary. Zero telemetry collected.

## Your Privacy Rights

### Data Control
- **Access**: View all data stored locally on your device
- **Export**: Export your data in standard formats
- **Delete**: Remove all data from your device


### Analytics Transparency
- **Open source**: Full analytics implementation available for review in our source code
- **Opt-in**: New and existing installs have analytics disabled until you turn it on
- **Questions**: Contact us for any analytics-related concerns

## Data Security

### Local Security

- Standard file system permissions protect your data
